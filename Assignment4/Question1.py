# We wrote this code to stimulates the rolling of two dices many times 500 upto 1000000.
# After that it adds the results and make for us a histogram of the sums.
# There is also a bar chart which shows how each sum 2-12 happens.
# As the number of rolls getting increasing the bar gets closer to the e probabilities
# As you roll the dice more and more times, the frequencies of each sum (2â€“12) get closer to their true probabilities.
